	<p>Dave Carter is a writer, musican, street-performer, radio presenter &amp; full time human being based in Sydney.</p>
	<p>In 2013 he released his first self-produced hip-hop record, and performed in 13 cities across Europe &amp; the US, from Rome, Paris and London to New York, Las Vegas and Black Rock City.</p>
	<p>Along the way he took punches to the face for his art in Berlin, rap-battled hustlers in Central Park and opened the world&rsquo;s first improvised musical buffet, the &ldquo;Artisan Beatery&rdquo; at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada, serving up fresh beatbox &amp; rhymes made-to-order.</p>
	<p>And now he&rsquo;s home in Sydney, walking and talking the fine line between real and dream.</p>
	<p>Dave developed &amp; presents the radio show TrackSuits, fronts  4-piece rocktronica outfit Spectacles and performs poetry, hiphop and improvised music made-to-order in his musical restaurant on the streets &amp; on stages everywhere.<br>
